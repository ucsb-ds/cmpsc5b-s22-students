    "# Final Project: Movie Classification\n",
    "Welcome to the Final Project of CMPSC 5B (DS 2)!  You will build a classifier that guesses whether a movie is a comedy or a thriller, using only the number of times words appear in the movies's screenplay.  By the end of the project, you should know how to:\n",

    "1. Build a k-nearest-neighbors classifier.\n",
    "2. Test a classifier on data.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must **complete Part 1-2 of the project (out of 4) and submit it by 11:59pm on Wednesday, March 9, during Week 10**.  You may or may not have lab time to work on these questions, we recommend that you start early on each part to stay on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This project is due during Finals Week, at 11:59pm on Wednesday, March 16. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; this partner **does not** need to be from the same lab section. Only one of you is required to submit the project. In Gradescope, the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit. Here is how you [add a group member in Gradescope](https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for other courses (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or ULA for help. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Also, please be sure to not re-assign variables throughout the notebook! For example, if you use max_temperature in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on.\n",
