    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Final Project of CMPSC 5B (DS 2)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a roadmap for this project:\n",
    "* In Part 1, we'll investigate the correlations between some penguin features and build a linear regression model.\n",
    "* In Part 2, we'll build a classification model to have python try and classify each type of penguin based on its features.\n",
    "* In Part 3, you'll design your own model (either linear regression or classification) using the whichever dataset.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must **complete Part 1 project and submit it by Week 10** (check Gradescope for exact due date)  You may or may not have lab time to work on these questions, we recommend that you start early on each part to stay on track. Since your Final Project (checkpoint) is your first draft of your project, we want to give you feedback so that you can make corrections for the full submission. Because of this, we will not accept late submissions for your Checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** The full project is due during Finals Week, during Finals Week (check Gradescope for exact due date). It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now. Because of the quick turnaround with course grades being due June 15, we will not be accepting late submissions for your full submission either.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; this partner **does not** need to be from the same lab section. Only one of you is required to submit the project. In Gradescope, the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit. Here is how you [add a group member in Gradescope](https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for other courses (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or ULA for help. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Also, please be sure to not re-assign variables throughout the notebook! For example, if you use max_temperature in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on.\n",

The Chinstrap penguin shares some characteristics with the other two, so it might be hard to identify this type of penguin based on the data we have.

It doesn’t have to be a paragraph for each section, just some sentences to help guide the readers through what you are doing. This will make your project easier for us to understand, as well as showcasing how well you understand which method you choose to do. Example could be something like:\n",

    " - “Here we used r to compute our slope, and our slope to compute the intercept”\n",

Explain what the slope and intercept means in the scope of your data, calculate the RMSE to evaluate the performance of your regression line (not done in this project, but reference an old homework), and do some outside research to explain why you think you got the result that you did.\n",
    " - For KNN Classification, we would like you to build a classification model with the features you chose (at least 3)  and calculate the accuracy score. Then, we would like you to tune your model in two 2 ways: One is changing the k value to a different number (pretty simple), and the other way is adding/removing features to your model (for example, we could have only used 3 columns instead of 4 in our penguin classifier). We want you to experiment with changing up your models in different ways (should have at least 3 models with different parameters in the end) to really showcase how these parameters affect your model. Lastly, we want you to explain what difficulties your KNN classifier may have in relation to your project (as in, what are some reasons your model misclassified your data) and what are some possible ways to solve these issues."
